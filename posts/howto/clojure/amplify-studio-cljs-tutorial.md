# Amplify Studio / Figma / Clojurescript / Reagent Tutorial

Implements the AWS Tutorial [Build a Vacation Rental Site with Amplify Studio](https://welearncode.com/studio-vacation-site/) but instead of being Javascript based, uses Clojurescript for the project implementation. It does incorporate the Javascript output of Amplify Studio but all code to use it is in Clojurescript.

### Tooling Used in the project:

- [Create Reagent App](https://github.com/AutoScreencast/create-reagent-app) to create the project scaffold
- [Clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org) (The whole point of this article!)
- [Shadow-CLJS](http://shadow-cljs.org/) as the build tool / compiler
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) Key to preping JSX and JS Files from Amplify Studio and UI Components to be used with shadlow-cljs transpiled clojurescript.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io) Used by webpack to convert JSX to JS
- [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) (CLJS wrapper around [React](https://reactjs.org/)) for building your user interface
- [Amplify Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/studio/) and all the related [AWS Amplify tooling](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- [Figma AWS Amplify UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1047600760128127424)

## Prerequisites

### Setup an Amplify Studio Project

All the initial setup of the Amplify Studio Project on AWS and the associated Figma project is already described in the first part of the excellent [Build a Vacation Rental Site with Amplify Studio](https://welearncode.com/studio-vacation-site/) so will not repeat it here.

That first part of the article will have you do all the following in the appropriate Web Consoles and services AWS and Figma). You won't be doing any CLI commands on your local dev computer:

- Setup an Amplify Studio project via the Amplify Sandbox
- Create a basic data model in Amplify Studio
- Deploy the start of the Amplify project to AWS
- Create some sample data
- Set up a Figma project using the Amplify UI Components and shows you how to modify it
- Import the modified Figma project into the Amplify project
- Link the data model and the UI Component in Amplify Studio
- Create a collection view using Amplify Studio

**Start by following the instructions from the original article, [Build a Vacation Rental Site with Amplify Studio](https://welearncode.com/studio-vacation-site/), up thru to the section: `Pull to Studio`**

Once you have completed that, come back to here and follow the rest of this post at this point.

## Creating an Amplify Studio App with Clojurescript

This is the actual instructions on how to create your Amplify Studio app in Clojurescript instead of Javascript. It replaces the remainder all the content after `Pull to Studio` from the original article [Build a Vacation Rental Site with Amplify Studio](https://welearncode.com/studio-vacation-site/).

### Create a git repo with shadow-cljs / reagent scaffolding

Instead of using `create-react-app` that would have created a Javascript/React app, we’re going to use [create-reagent-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-reagent-app) to create the scaffolding of a shadow-cljs / reagent / react app repo.

In this tutorial, we will make this a git repo and snapshot the state at every stage so that if you make a mistake you can go back to an earlier step.

```bash
npx create-reagent-app  amplifystudio-cljs-tutorial
cd amplifystudio-cljs-tutorial
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial Commit after create-reagent-app"
npm-install
```

### Add webpack and related dependencies

Shadow-cljs can not directly consume JSX files that are the output of the Figma plugin and it needs some help to incorporate the AWS UI Components files that Amplify Studio injects into the project.

The use of Babel to prepare JSX files for Shadow-cljs is based on info from [Shadow CLJS User’s Guide - JavaScript Dialects](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_javascript_dialects). This tutorial moves the babel management into webpack configuration as described later on.

The following dependencies are needed primarily to install webpack and its dependencies.

`html-webpack-plugin` and `html-beautifier-webpack-plugin` are used to inject the proper JS include for the output of webpack into the index.html.

```bash
npm i -D @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-env babel-loader html-webpack-plugin html-beautifier-webpack-plugin process webpack webpack-cli
```

Then update any dependencies to the latest versions
If you don’t already have it, install [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates)

```
npm install -g npm-check-updates
```

And then run it to update any dependencies to the latest versions ignoring specified versions in the package.json.

I like to start projects with the latest versions of everything. But you could just make sure `shadow-cljs` is the latest version, best to stay latest with that.

If you run it without the `-u` it will just show you what it would update and you could manually update the ones you care about.

```bash
ncu -u
npm install
```

### Update your local git repo

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Snapshot after adding webpack dependencies"
```

If you want, you could push it to your own remote Github or other repository

### Add AWS Dependencies

- AWS Account
  - If you don’t already have an AWS account, you’ll need to create one in order to follow the steps outlined in this tutorial. [Create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)
- Amplify CLI
  If you don’t already have the Amplify CLI installed you can install it with

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

- Configure Account / IAM / CLI to work with Amplify
  If you already have an AWS account you want to use and you have things setup in your workstation / Terminal to use AWS CLI via profiles in ~/.aws/credentials, you can just set your profile in your terminal for the profile to use

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=<your profile>
```

and you don’t need to do `amplify configure`.

If you haven’t set up aws amplify on your local dev machine before, follow the instructions at [Configure the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/#configure-the-amplify-cli)

### Install the aws-amplify libraries in your project

Still at the top of the `amplifystudio-cljs-tutorial` repo, install the libraries

```bash
npm i aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

You might want to commit the changes to git just as a snapshot in case the next step messes anything up.

```bash
git commit -a -m "After adding amplify deps"
```

### Sync repo with Amplify project

Using the amplify CLI, pull the project info and ui-components into your repo.

You’ll get the command to do this from your Amplify Apps page that was created earlier.
![](/_images/aws-amplify-console2.png)

If you are using an AWS account via IAM, you should log in to your AWS Console on your default browser. The following command is going to open up your default browser to authenticate to AWS.

If you are not using AWS IAM for auth, but are using the Amplify Console that has its own username/password style login, you don’t need to do anything in advance.

**DON’T TYPE THIS EXACT LINE**
Use the line from your environment as it has the appID for your application
The following line is just an example

```bash
amplify pull --appId dgt42342sdv765la --envName staging
```

This will eventually open a browser page to authenticate the process. As mentioned earlier, if you are using IAM for access, its easiest if you logged into the AWS Console with your browser first. If you forget to do this, you can still login now, and copy and past the link shown in the output of the CLI command and it will retry authenticating.

If you are using the Amplify Studio username/password, you will get that dialog on the browser and you can fill it in and click Yes

![](/_images/amplify-studio5.png)

It will then prompt you for a bunch of things to set up your amplify project in this repo

```

Enter `public` for `Distribution Directory Path`
This build puts everything in `public` but other scaffolding or cljs projects may use some other path. It should be the same as the directory above `js` in the `output-dir` parameter in `shadow-cljs.edn`

You can keep the defaults for `Build Command` and `Start Command`

The rest of the config inputs and outputs:

```

? Do you plan on modifying this backend? (Y/n) Y
```

Say `Y` for `Do you plan on modifying this backend? `

You might want to checkpoint your git repo again after this.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "After pulling Amplify Studio project"
```

You can make sure the basic reagent setup is still working by doing:

```bash
npm start
```

The first time you run this, it will take a while to download all the Clojurescript / Clojure dependencies.

And see that the app is running at `http://localhost:3000`
You will just see `Create Reagent App` on the page as a header.

## Update to support mixing webpack with shadow-cljs

Based on David Vujic’s work [Agile & Coding: Hey Webpack, Hey ClojureScript](https://davidvujic.blogspot.com/2021/08/hey-webpack-hey-clojurescript.html) we’re going to add mechanisms to build the javascript code using webpack and the clojurescript code with shadow-cljs. This is necessary when using more recent versions of the AWS Amplify libraries.

### Make sure Shadow-cljs dependencies are up to date

In `shadow-cljs.edn` make sure that the dependencies are up to date (you can check for the latest versions at [Clojars](https://clojars.org/))

```clojure
 :dependencies
 [[reagent            "1.1.0"]
  [binaryage/devtools "1.0.4"]]
```

### Shadow-cljs js-options

Add the following lines to shadow-cljs.edn between the `:asset-path` and `:modules` stanzas in the `:app` section as per [Thomas Heller](https://github.com/thheller)'s article
[How about webpack now?](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2020/05/08/how-about-webpack-now.html)

```clojure
   :js-options {:js-provider    :external
                :external-index "target/index.js"}
```

### Make a template from index.html

Webpack will be used to update index.html with the proper script include that points to the webpack bundle.

#### Move `public/index.html` to `public/index.html.tmpl`

```bash
mv public/index.html public/index.html.tmpl
```

#### Edit `public/index.html.tmpl`

- Add `defer` to the main script tag

Change:

```html
<script src="/js/main.js"></script>
```

To:

```html
<script defer src="/js/main.js"></script>
```

#### Add in a sytlesheet for the fonts

- Add the following line after the other `link` tags in `<head>`

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter:slnt,wght@-10..0,100..900&display=swap"
/>
```

#### Copy the Amplify CSS to public

Note that the source is `styles.css` (plural) and the destination is `style.css` (singular)

```bash
cp node_modules/@aws-amplify/ui/dist/styles.css public/css/style.css
```

## Update the scaffold Clojurescript code to support Amplify

Here's where we actually get to the actually writing of some code to use the Amplify UI Components in an App.

Edit `src/main/amplifystudio_cljs_tutorial/app/core.cljs` with the following changes

### Add the dependencies for the `require`

Add the aws amplify and ui imports to the require so it looks like:

Note that the `amplify pull` will populate `src/amplify/ui-components` and the `webpack` execution described further on, will set things up so the `"ui-components/CardACollection"` require can be fulfilled.

`src/amplify` should _NOT_ be in the clojure[script] class path (usually set in shadow-cljs.edn `:source-paths` map)

```clojure
(ns amplifystudio-cljs-tutorial.app.core
  (:require [reagent.dom :as rdom]
            ["/aws-exports" :default ^js aws-exports]
            ["aws-amplify" :refer [Amplify] :as amplify]
            ["@aws-amplify/ui-react" :refer [AmplifyProvider]]
            ["ui-components/RentalCollection" :default RentalCollection]))
```

### Update the `app` function

This is the actual initial page code that is run by the render function. It is primarily [hiccup](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/doc/UsingHiccupToDescribeHTML.md) syntax.

> Hiccup describes HTML elements and user-defined components as a nested ClojureScript vector.
>
> - The first element is either a keyword or a symbol
>   - If it is a keyword, the element is an HTML element where (name keyword) is the tag of the HTML element.
>   - If it is a symbol, reagent will treat the vector as a component, as described in the next section.
> - If the second element is a map, it represents the attributes to the element. The attribute map may be omitted.
> - Any additional elements must either be Hiccup vectors representing child nodes or string literals representing child text nodes.

This code:

- Displays an `h1` header
- Wraps the `RentalCollection` we created in Figma / ui-components with the `AmplifyProvider`

The `:>` is a function, [adapt-react-class](http://reagent-project.github.io/docs/master/reagent.core.html#var-adapt-react-class), that tells hiccup/reagent to interpret the next symbol as a React Component.
More info at: [React Features in Reagent](https://cljdoc.org/d/reagent/reagent/1.1.0/doc/tutorials/react-features)

The `app` function:

```clojure
(defn app []
  [:> AmplifyProvider
  [:h1 "Amplify Studio Tutorial"]
   [:> RentalCollection]])
```

For comparison here is the equivalent Javascript:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <AmplifyProvider>
      <RentalCollection />
    </AmplifyProvider>
  );
}
```

### Update the `main` function

This function is the first code called in the program. It is where you would put any initialization code and then it calls the render function that kicks of the reagent/react event loop.

- Add a bit of logging so we can see that we're hitting the code at runtime
- Add the Amplify initialization code.

```clojure
(defn ^:export main []
  (js/console.log "main top")
  (-> Amplify (.configure aws-exports))
  (render))
```

In the Clojurescript statement:

```clojure
(-> Amplify (.configure aws-exports))
```

`->` is the [thread-first macro](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/-%3E). In this case it means that `Amplify` will be passed in as the second argument of the following form. I.E. its the equivalent to this Clojurescript statement:

```clojure
(.configure Amplify aws-exports)
```

In ether case, it is the Javascript interop equivalent to:

```javascript
Amplify.configure(config);
```

## Setup Webpack / Babel

### Babel config file

Babel does the work of converting JSX files to Javascript files suitable for consumption by webpack and shadow-cljs. It is called by webpack.

Create the file `.babelrc` in the top level of the repo with the content:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

This tells babel to run the presets:

> [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) is a smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your target environment(s). This both makes your life easier and JavaScript bundles smaller!

and

> [@babel/preset-react](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#docsNav) loads the following plugins:
>
> [@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-syntax-jsx) - enables parsing of JSX
> [@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx) - transform JSX to Javascript
> [@babel/plugin-transform-react-display-name](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-display-name) - Set displayName in the Javascript
>
> And with the development option Classic runtime adds:
>
> [@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx-self) - sets `self` in the transformed code
> [@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-source](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx-source) - injects the source information (file, lineno) into the the Javascript

### Webpack configuration file

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/):

> At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.

We are using it to convert the JSX `ui-component` files from Figma/Amplify Studio into vanilla Javascript via babel.

Webpack is also being used to bundle the `src/amplify/models` and `src/amplify/ui-components` directories/files that are pulled from amplify into the repo as modules so that their objects can be `imported` into the app. This is configured in the `resolve` block below.

This will be a webpack configuration file, `webpack.config.js` in the top level of the repo. The following will describe the elements we're going to use in that file.

#### Requires

The following requires the webpack modules and plugins used

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const webpack = require("webpack");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const HtmlBeautifierPlugin = require("html-beautifier-webpack-plugin");
```

#### Basic Webpack config

- Set mode to development
- `entry` - The file generated by shadow-cljs describing all the require/imports seen in the code
- `output` - Where webpack should put its final bundle of javascript that will be included by a `<script>` tag in the index.html
- `devtool` - Tells webpack to generate source maps to be consumed by the browser devtools

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./target/index.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "public"),
    filename: "js/libs/bundle.js",
    clean: false,
  },
  devtool: "source-map",
```

#### Rules

This is the main directives that tell weback what to do.

- `test: /\.m?js/,` - Regex that specifies what file types to apply to the first rule to (ones that end with `.mjs` or `.js`)
  - `fullySpecified: false` - the import / require statements should not end with file suffixes
  - `alias` - Maps the path to the javascript files to a module name. This allows the code to require the Amplify Studio `models` and `ui-components` as importable modules.
- `test: /\.jsx$/` - Regex that specifies which file types to apply to the second rule (JSX files)
  - `exclude` - Don't apply it to files installed by npm in `/node_modules/`
  - `use` - Apply babel to the JSX files. The `.babelrc` file specified earlier tells babel to transform the JSX files to vanilla javascript

```javascript
    rules: [
      {
        // docs: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#resolvefullyspecified
        test: /\.m?js/,
        resolve: {
          fullySpecified: false,
          alias: {
            models: "../src/amplify/models/index.js",
            "ui-components": "../src/amplify/ui-components",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.jsx$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: ["babel-loader"],
      },
    ],
```

#### Plugins

This is where plugins are loaded.

- `process` - This was needed as webpack 5 no longer includes a polyfil for the `process` Node.js variable. There were some dependencies that required `process.env`
- [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/) - Enables creating `public/index.html` from a temlate so that webpack can inject the path to its bundle into the index.html. Also useful if you want to automate the updates of the index.html for other things.
- [HtmlBeautifierPlugin](https://github.com/zamanruhy/html-beautifier-webpack-plugin#readme) Cleans up the index.html with proper newlines mainly

```javascript
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: "process/browser",
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./public/index.html.tmpl",
      filename: "index.html",
    }),
    new HtmlBeautifierPlugin(),
  ],
```

The Html plugins / index.html templating are not totally necessary. You could just add your own script tag to index.html instead such as:

```html
<script defer src="js/libs/bundle.js"></script>
```

#### The full `webpack.config.js`

Create a file `webpack.config.js` also at the top level of the repo with the content:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const webpack = require("webpack");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const HtmlBeautifierPlugin = require("html-beautifier-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./target/index.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "public"),
    filename: "js/libs/bundle.js",
    clean: false,
  },
  devtool: "source-map",
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        // docs: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#resolvefullyspecified
        test: /\.m?js/,
        resolve: {
          fullySpecified: false,
          alias: {
            models: "../src/amplify/models/index.js",
            "ui-components": "../src/amplify/ui-components",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.jsx$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: ["babel-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ["", ".js", ".jsx"],
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: "process/browser",
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./public/index.html.tmpl",
      filename: "index.html",
    }),
    new HtmlBeautifierPlugin(),
  ],
};
```

#### Add a script to run webpack

Add the following line to the `”scripts”` section of `package.json`. It will allow you to run a that will update the bundle automatically when you change any of the amplify files or when shadow-cljs updates the `target/index.js`

```json
    "pack": "webpack --watch"
```

### Update git

#### Update .gitignore

add the following to `.gitignore`

```git-config
/target/
```

#### Add all the new files to the commit

git add -A
git commit -m "Sync up all the final changes"

## Running the development service locally

Start the shadow-cljs watch process. (`shadow-cljs watch app`) using the npm command:

```bash
npm start
```

And in another terminal window, also at the top of the repo run the webpack watch process:

```
npm run pack

```

Should see something like the following. The images and values are dependent on how you set up the data when following along with the first part of the [Build a Vacation Rental Site with Amplify Studio](https://welearncode.com/studio-vacation-site/).

![Initial Integration View](/_images/working-basic-integration.png)

## Troubleshooting

If when you start the shadow-cljs process, `npm start`, and you get something like:

```bash
...
shadow-cljs - watching build :app
[:app] Configuring build.
[:app] Compiling ...
[2022-01-02 21:55:15.214 - WARNING] :shadow.cljs.devtools.server.util/handle-ex - {:msg {:type :start-autobuild}}
AssertionError Assert failed: (map? rc)
...
```

The `js-provider :external` config in `shadow-cljs.edn` is masking the actual error. In order to see what the error is, comment out the `:js-options` block in `shadow-cljs.edn` like:

```edn
:builds
 {:app
  {:target     :browser
   :output-dir "public/js"
   :asset-path "/js"
   ;; :js-options {:js-provider    :external
   ;;              :external-index "target/index.js"}
   :modules    {:main
                {:init-fn amplifystudio-cljs-tutorial.app.core/main}}}

```

and then run `npm start` again and see what the error is. Correct the error and then remember to uncomment the `:js-options` block.

## Completing the Tutorial with Amplify UI Overrides

We pick back up the original tutorial at the `Use a Prop` section to show how the UI Components can be customized just with Component Props and runtime Overrides.

Overrides are a powerful feature that are builtin to the Amplify UI Components and allow you to inject attributes into the children of components at runtime. It makes the Amplify UI Components very flexible without having to modify the actual code of the components. This allows you to update the Figma design aspects and still update your local copy of the ui-components with an `amplify pull` since you don't make local changes to that code.

### Use a Prop

> You can customize these React components in your own code. First, you can use props in order to modify your components. If you wanted to make your grid of rentals into a list, for example, you could pass the prop type="list" to your RentalCollection.

In Javascript you would say:

```javascript
<RentalCollection type="list" />
```

and in Clojurescript:

```clojure
[:> RentalCollection {:type "list"}]
```

#### And that will make the view go from a grid to a list:

![Colllection as a list](/_images/collection-as-list.png)

The props are listed for each component type at [Amplify UI Connected Components](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/components)

### Use an Override

Overrides allow you to inject props into the children of a component.

In our example RentalCollection, the images in the child cards are kind of squashed. To fix that we want to set the `objectFit` prop of the image element of the card to `cover`.

In Javascript you would use:

```javascript
<RentalCollection
  type="list"
  overrides={{
    "Collection.CardA[0]": {
      overrides: {
        "Flex.Image[0]": { objectFit: "cover" },
      },
    },
  }}
/>
```

In Clojurescript we use:

```clojure
[:> RentalCollection {:type "list"
                      :overrides {"Collection.CardA[0]"
                                  {:overrides {"Flex.Image[0]"
                                               {:object-fit "cover"}}}}}]])
```

#### Now the images are no longer squished:

![objectFit cover prop applied to children images](/_images/props-applied-to-children.png)

## Themes and Conclusion

That completes showing the differences of using Clojurescript instead of Javascript with Amplify Studio and Amplify UI Connected Components.

You can refer back to the original AWS Tutorial [Build a Vacation Rental Site with Amplify Studio](https://welearncode.com/studio-vacation-site/) for the remaining content on how to use the [AWS Amplify Theme Editor](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1040722185526429545/AWS-Amplify-Theme-Editor) in Figma to add a theme to the UI Components. This should work without having to change any of your Clojurescript code as you modify the Ui component code that you load via `amplify pull` via Figma.

It is also possible to [apply themes directly in your code](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/theming). Doing that with Clojurescript will be left to a possible future article.
